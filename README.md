# Simple-Work-Day-Scheduler

This is a simple daily planner for important events.

When you open the planner current day and time is displayed at the top of the calendar.

Bellow the current day and time you will find blocks for standard business hours.

Each time block is colored to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future.

When you click into a time block, then you can enter an event, when you start typing it will change a color. 

When you click the save button for that time block, the text for that event is saved in local storage and the color changes to default.

After page refresh, the events persist.

You can grab on event time and drag it to a different time place to rearrange events.

If you want to delete all events just press “Clear All” button.
